        <h3 class="page-heading">Why sloth is one of the most incredible animals</h3>

    <p>Sloths are one of the most amazing creatures on this planet and I am going to tell you exactly why!</p>

    <p>First of all it's very important to state that you can never trust a sloth. There are two types of sloth, there is the
    two-toed sloth and the three-toed sloth. You might be thinking that the two-toed sloth has two toes? WRONG, these
    devious sloths actually has 3 toes just like the three-toed sloths, but THEY however only has two fingers! That's crazy!</p>

    <h3>But not only are the sloths awesome, they also know the definition of chill!</h3>

    <p>The sloths are very calm animals, and rightly so because they are awesome. Sloths enjoy spending their time chilling
    from branches, eating leafs and living the life. But do not approach this awesome creature with ill intent, even tough
    the sloth is awesome, it is a fierce animal. If threatened the sloth will run at you, upside-down with their massive claws!
        Now if that isn't awesome I don't know what is!

    <h3>The sloths are awesome throughout history!</h3>

    <p>Yes it's true sloths is an amazing animal that no one is even close to compete with, but historically sloths was
    even more awesome! To begin to fathom the fundamental historical depth of their awesomeness we have to go back to
    their roots. The sloth family is very old and its forefather; The Megatherium. An ancient sloth that was just as big
    as an elephant! Roaming the face of earth with claws the size of your forearm. Scary isn't it?
    But do not worry, we are not living in the past. Even tough the modern sloth might not be as scary as the older one,
    it is still very much awesome.</p>

    <h4>What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?</h4>
    <p>-I love the idea of implementing variables and functions, however I have a hard time using them because I tend to
    automatically use normal css when coding. I think it will take me a bit more time to adapt to scss and make logical code with it
        <br>-Since I really liked how the template was structured I merely reused it's scss code for example coloring. I added a few
        changes to some of the statements in the scss code but overall, I mostly reused the code that already existed.
        <br>-I can't really see any cons to scss files, because how I've understood it is that if you don't like scss code, you can still
        type css in scss files. So scss only gives you more choice of coding, more perks and free hands how to change html files.

    <h4>What do you think of static site generators?</h4>

    <p>I like static site generators, it is a fun and easy way to create websites. But what I like about it mostly is that
    the static site generators is an extremely efficient way to depict information when traffic peaks in an abnormal rate.</p>

    <h4>What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</h4>

    <p>When a robot reads a website it replaces the index file and add robots.txt, reads the file and goes through the
    authors wished restrictions. I added a robots.txt file so it can read what it is preferred to read. I also added a META
    tag to tell the robot not to index any content of the side, nor to follow any links added.</p>

    <h4>What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</h4>

    <p>It is a simple text file that contains the information of the creators that made the site, their tools and
    external help</p>

    <h4>How did you implements comments to blog posts</h4>

    <p>I followed the link that was recommended on examination assignment 1. I followed Disqus guide, which included adding account
        implementing the code they posted and through that I added a comment field on the specific layout post, which is only intended
        for index file similar to blog.</p>

    <h4>What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?</h4>

    <p>How I understood it, is to turn your website to a version of an add. where users get an initial read on your website
    like an headline for a magazine. Picture, title, type and address. So I added it to the head file. So every page on the website
    has a introduction when other websites tags my website.</p>
