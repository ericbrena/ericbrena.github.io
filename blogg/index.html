    <h1 class="page-heading">Why sloth is one of the most incredible animals</h1>

    <p>Sloths are one of the most amazing creatures on this planet and I am going to tell you exactly why!</p>

    <p>First of all it's very important to state that you can never trust a sloth. There are two types of sloth, there is the
    two-toed sloth and the three-toed sloth. You might be thinking that the two-toed sloth has two toes? WRONG, these
    devious sloths actually has 3 toes like the three-toed sloths, but They however only has two fingers! That's crazy!</p>

    <h2>But not only are the sloths awesome, they also know the definition of chill!</h2>

    <p>The sloths are a very calm animals, and rightly so because they are awesome. Sloths enjoy spending their time chilling
    from branches, eating leafs, living the life. But do not approach this awesome creature with ill intent, even tough
    the sloth is awesome, it is a fierce animal. If threatened the sloth will run at you, upside-down, with their massive claws!

    <h2>But wait! if you think sloths are awesome now just read this!</h2>

    <p>Yes it's true sloths is an amazing animal that no one is even close to compete with, but historically sloths was
    even more awesome! To begin to fathom the fundamental historical depth of their awesomeness we have to go back to
    their roots. The sloth family is very old and its forefather, The Megatherium. an ancient sloth that was just as big
    as an elephant! Roaming the face of earth with claws the size of your forearm. Scary? Isn't it?
    But do not worry, we are not living in the past. Even tough the modern sloth might not be as scary as the older one,
    it is still very much awesome.</p>
