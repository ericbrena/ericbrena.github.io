<h4>What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?</h4>
<p>-I love the idea of implementing variables and functions, however I have a hard time using them because I tend to
    automatically use normal css when coding. I think it will take me a bit more time to adapt to scss and make logical code with it
    <br>-Since I really liked how the template was structured I merely reused it's scss code for example coloring. I added a few
    changes to some of the statements in the scss code but overall, I mostly reused the code that already existed.
    <br>-I can't really see any cons to scss files, because how I've understood it is that if you don't like scss code, you can still
    type css in scss files. So scss only gives you more choice of coding, more perks and free hands how to change html files.

<h4>What do you think of static site generators?</h4>

<p>I like static site generators, it is a fun and easy way to create websites. But what I like about it mostly is that
    the static site generators is an extremely efficient way to depict information when traffic peaks in an abnormal rate.</p>

<h4>What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</h4>

<p>When a robot reads a website it replaces the index file and add robots.txt, reads the file and goes through the
    authors wished restrictions. I added a robots.txt file so it can read what it is preferred to read. I also added a META
    tag to tell the robot not to index any content of the side, nor to follow any links added.</p>

<h4>What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</h4>

<p>It is a simple text file that contains the information of the creators that made the site, their tools and
    external help</p>

<h4>How did you implements comments to blog posts</h4>

<p>I followed the link that was recommended on examination assignment 1. I followed Disqus guide, which included adding account
    implementing the code they posted and through that I added a comment field on the specific layout post, which is only intended
    for index file similar to blog.</p>

<h4>What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?</h4>

<p>How I understood it, is to turn your website to a version of an add. where users get an initial read on your website
    like an headline for a magazine. Picture, title, type and address. So I added it to the head file. So every page on the website
    has a introduction when other websites tags my website.</p>
